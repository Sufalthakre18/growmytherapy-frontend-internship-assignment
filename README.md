The goal of this was to:

* Accurately **clone an existing homepage UI** to test layout precision and frontend skills
* Creatively **redesign the cloned homepage** using a new therapist profile, theme, copy, and images
* Demonstrate **UI/UX sensibility, clean code practices, and thoughtful content adaptation**
* Add a **custom creative section** aligned with real-world client requirements

The final result is a **design-forward, calm, and therapy-focused website** built with **Next.js and Tailwind CSS**, tailored for an imaginary therapist: **Dr. Maya Reynolds, PsyD**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Next.js (App Router)**
* **React**
* **Tailwind CSS**

## 🌿 Development & Branch Strategy

### 1️⃣ UI Cloning Phase (Main Branch)

The **`main` branch** contains a **pixel-accurate clone** of the original reference template:

🔗 [https://lilac-template.squarespace.com/](https://lilac-template.squarespace.com/) (Password: lilac)

**Purpose of this phase:**

* Validate layout replication skills
* Match spacing, grid systems, and section hierarchy
* Ensure full responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile
* Follow original typography and styling without creative deviation

✅ No changes were made to colors, fonts, copy, or imagery in this phase

> **Note:** Reviewers can switch to the `main` branch to view the exact UI clone.

---

### 2️⃣ Creative Redesign Phase (Redesign Branch)

After completing the accurate clone, the project was redesigned using **Dr. Maya Reynolds’ profile** as the single source of truth.

This phase includes:

* A completely new **calm, eye-relaxing color palette**
* New **typography system** suited for a clinical psychology website
* Fully rewritten **SEO-friendly copy** based on the provided therapist profile
* All **new images** aligned with the theme and content

This separation reflects a real-world professional workflow: **baseline → redesign → refinement**.

---

## 🎨 Theme & Design System

The redesigned theme focuses on:

* Calmness
* Trust
* Emotional safety
* Minimal visual strain

### Design Highlights

* Soft neutral backgrounds with **subtle diagonal gradients** for depth
* Muted greens and warm neutrals inspired by therapy spaces
* Clear typographic hierarchy for readability
* Consistent spacing and rhythm across sections
* Gentle hover states and transitions

All colors, fonts, and UI elements are reused consistently across the website for maintainability.

---

## ✍️ Copywriting & SEO

All website copy was rewritten based strictly on **Dr. Maya Reynolds’ profile**, including:

* Hero section
* Services
* About section
* FAQs
* CTA messaging
* Office section content

### SEO Approach (Simple & Clean)

* Location-based keywords (Santa Monica, CA)
* Natural keyword integration (no stuffing)
* Clear heading structure (H1 → H2 → body text)
* Therapist specialties reflected in headings and content

The copy is written in a **human, empathetic tone**, avoiding clinical jargon while maintaining professionalism.

---

## 🖼️ Images & Visual Direction

All images were replaced with new ones that:

* Match the redesigned color palette
* Support the emotional tone of therapy
* Feel intentional and calm
* Align with each section’s purpose

This includes:

* Hero imagery
* Service-related visuals
* Office photography
* Therapist portrait (Dr. Maya Reynolds)

Image selection was treated as a **core design decision**, not decoration.

---

## 🏢 Custom Section: Our Office

A brand-new **“Our Office”** section was created as required by the assignment.

### Purpose of This Section

* Humanize the therapy experience
* Reduce anxiety before first visits
* Showcase the physical practice space

### Features

* Dedicated section layout (not present in original template)
* Office gallery with interactive thumbnails
* Active image descriptions
* Therapist card
* Location & session format details
* Seamless integration with site-wide design system

This section reflects how Grow My Therapy builds trust-driven websites for mental health professionals.

## 📱 Responsiveness

* Desktop

Layouts, typography, spacing, and interactions adapt smoothly across all breakpoints.

---

* Presented as a **client demo** for Dr. Maya Reynolds

* Explains design decisions in **non-technical language**

## 🙌 Final Notes

This project was approached as a **real client engagement**, not just a test task. Every decision—from spacing and color to copy tone and image selection—was made with the end user (a therapy client) in mind.

Thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate my skills, creativity, and attention to detail.
